Using Kotlin, MVVM, Retrofit, RxJava


This android assignment is following MVVM architecture and developed in Kotlin. I've used Retrofit and RxJava for network call. I implemented the logic for showing 2 different layouts with a single recyclerview. 
In order to match the design, I added PTSansCaption-Regular.ttf font and color '#5c845d'

Implemented Pull to refresh in order to load the articles.
Also, Formatting the date (yyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss): e.g. Mar 24, 2021 09:28 AM

Loading images:
  For Larger article, showing image from items/enclosure/link
  For Regular articles, showing image from items/thumbnail
